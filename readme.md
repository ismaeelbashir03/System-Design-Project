System Design Project - A university semester long project where myself and others built a autonomous bin delivery service paired with a web app, that allows users to:

  - Scan their rubbish with a ViT image classification model (report can be found in Misc. section of project_report.pdf)
  - change their location on a map
  - request a bin

Additionally, the robot itself can:

  - map an enviroment autonomously using SLAM and frontier exploration
  - autonomously naviagte this map using Djikstra's
  - navigate to multiple users in one trip following a FIFO queue
  - autonomously open and close dual lids representing recycyling or general waste

A full report on the project can be found in project_report.pdf
